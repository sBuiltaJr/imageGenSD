# Overview
This is a list of possible upgrades/updates that may be added to the project.
They're listed here so as to not be forgotten.  Neither list is in priority
order. [The discord.py github](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/tree/master/examples) has many examples for reference.

## Bug-fixes
(These items have higher priority but aren't guaranteed to be first).

## Investigations
(Items that may not be bugs but should still be investigated)
- Determine why the discord.py examples always requrie hard-coding a guild. (should be auto-detectable?)
- Determine how to properly background the task (discord.py has some examples, may not work as needed?)

## Planned
- Allow a bot to manage multiple guilds
- Allow a bot to shard
- Crash recovery
- Guild info command (for setting parameters)

## Unplanned
- weeb shit
